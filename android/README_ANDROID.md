5. Start the emulator

## üîß Building the Android App

### Quick Build (Recommended)

Use the provided build script:
```bash
# From project root directory
./android/build_android.sh
```

This script will:
- Clean previous builds
- Install dependencies
- Build both debug and release APKs
- Show file locations and sizes

### Manual Build Process

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Build Debug APK**:
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --debug
   ```
   Output: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`

3. **Build Release APK**:
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   ```
   Output: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

4. **Build App Bundle (for Play Store)**:
   ```bash
   flutter build appbundle --release
   ```
   Output: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

## üì¶ APK Installation & Distribution

### Installing APK on Device

#### Via ADB (Command Line)
```bash
# Install debug APK
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk

# Install release APK
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

# Reinstall (if already installed)
adb install -r build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

#### Via File Transfer
1. Copy APK file to device storage
2. Open file manager on device
3. Tap APK file and install
4. Enable "Install unknown apps" if prompted

### Distribution Methods

#### 1. Direct APK Distribution
- **Pros**: Simple, no store approval needed
- **Cons**: Users must enable "Unknown sources"
- **Use cases**: Beta testing, internal distribution

#### 2. Google Play Store
- **Pros**: Wide reach, automatic updates, trusted source
- **Cons**: Requires developer account ($25), review process
- **Process**: Upload App Bundle (.aab file)

#### 3. Alternative App Stores
- **F-Droid**: For open-source apps
- **Amazon Appstore**: Alternative distribution
- **Samsung Galaxy Store**: Samsung device focus

## üîê App Signing & Release Configuration

### Debug Signing (Development)
The app is automatically signed with debug keys for development and testing.

### Release Signing (Production)

#### 1. Generate Signing Key
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/sredna-skorost-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias sredna-skorost
```

#### 2. Configure Gradle Signing
Create `android/key.properties`:
```properties
storePassword=your_store_password
keyPassword=your_key_password
keyAlias=sredna-skorost
storeFile=/path/to/sredna-skorost-key.jks
```

#### 3. Update build.gradle.kts
Add signing configuration to `android/app/build.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin
android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            keyAlias = keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
            keyPassword = keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
            storeFile = file(keystoreProperties['storeFile'])
            storePassword = keystoreProperties['storePassword']
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
        }
    }
}
```

## üêõ Android-Specific Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

#### "Android SDK not found"
```bash
# Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"

# Verify with flutter doctor
flutter doctor
```

#### "Gradle build failed"
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --debug
```

#### "License not accepted"
```bash
flutter doctor --android-licenses
# Accept all licenses by typing 'y'
```

### Runtime Issues

#### "Location permissions denied"
1. Open device Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Sredna Skorost BG ‚Üí Permissions
2. Enable Location permissions (Allow all the time)
3. Restart the app

#### "App not installing"
1. Enable "Install unknown apps" in Android settings
2. Check device storage space
3. Try installing via ADB: `adb install -f app-release.apk`

#### "GPS not working"
1. Ensure location services are enabled on device
2. Check app has location permissions
3. Test GPS with other apps to verify hardware
4. Try restarting the device

### Development Issues

#### "Device not detected"
```bash
# Check ADB connection
adb devices

# If no devices listed:
adb kill-server
adb start-server

# Enable USB debugging on device
```

#### "Build tools version errors"
1. Open Android Studio
2. Go to SDK Manager
3. Update Android SDK Build-Tools to latest version
4. Accept any license agreements

## üìä Performance Optimization

### APK Size Optimization
```bash
# Build optimized APK with app bundle
flutter build appbundle --release

# Split APKs by architecture
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
```

### Battery Optimization
- The app is configured to handle Android's battery optimization
- Users may need to disable battery optimization for background GPS tracking
- Settings ‚Üí Battery ‚Üí Battery optimization ‚Üí Sredna Skorost BG ‚Üí Don't optimize

# Security Guidelines for Sredna Skorost BG

This is an open-source project. To protect personal data:

### Developers
- **Apple Developer Team ID**: Set your own team ID in Xcode locally, not in version control
- **Git Configuration**: Use proper git config with public email addresses
- **Build Artifacts**: Never commit build files or certificates

### User Data
- **No Analytics**: The app doesn't collect any analytics or telemetry
- **Local Storage Only**: All user data stays on the device
- **No Network Calls**: App works completely offline
- **No Personal Information**: GPS coordinates are processed locally only

## üö´ What NOT to Commit

- Apple Developer Team IDs or certificates
- Android signing keys or passwords
- Personal file paths or machine names
- Build artifacts or generated files
- SSL certificates or private keys
- Local configuration files

1. **Configure Git Identity** (use public email):
   ```bash
   git config user.name "Your Name"
   git config user.email "your.public@email.com"
   ```

2. **Set iOS Development Team** in Xcode:
   - Open ios/Runner.xcodeproj in Xcode
   - Select Runner target ‚Üí Signing & Capabilities
   - Set your own Team ID (not committed to repo)
